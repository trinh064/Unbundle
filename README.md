# Unbundle
A lossless compressing program that removed spaces in a text file to reduce its size and reinserted them when decompressing, decreasing the size of that fileâ€™s ZIP by 3-4%.
This program does not support text with many paragraphs yet 
The file needs to be compressed has to be a human readable text, if there is any word longer than 16 characters, the program will fail 

Run the runthis.py to execute the program
